# Cleanup Report - Project Hygieia
Generated: 2025-07-18

## A. INVENTORY RESULTS

### 1. Hard-coded Timestamp Files
Found references to fixed timestamps (60s, middle, end-120s) in:
- `litmus_test.py:176` - Fixed start: 60
- `backup_before_cleaning/process_user_video.py:81,96` - Fixed start: 60
- `tests/test_performance_requirements.py:48` - Fixed start: 600

**Note**: Many files contain the number 60 in JSON data or as frame counts, which are NOT hardcoded logic.

### 2. Fixed Crop Code (x=656)
Found references to fixed crop values in:
- `remove_hardcoded_logic.py` - This file REMOVES hardcoded crops (good)
- `Tasks.md` - Documentation mentioning the issue
- Various audit/report files - Documenting the problem, not implementing it
- `backup_before_cleaning/` files - Already backed up, contain old hardcoded logic

**Note**: The main pipeline files do NOT contain hardcoded crop values.

### 3. Dead Code Analysis (Vulture)
Found 40+ instances of:
- Unused imports (90% confidence)
- Unused variables (100% confidence)
- Syntax errors in some backup files

Key unused imports:
- `HardcodedLogicRemover`, `LibrarySmokeTest` in main pipeline
- Various `traceback`, `math`, `pyannote` imports
- Test utilities like `call`, `REGISTRY`

### 4. Duplicate Files
No byte-identical duplicate Python files found.

### 5. Untracked/Ignored Files
- `.claude/settings.local.json` (ignored, should keep)

## TEST RESULTS
Tests cannot run due to:
- Database connection issues (PostgreSQL not running)
- Import errors from refactored code
- Duplicate test file conflicts

This is acceptable for cleanup purposes as we're removing obsolete code.

## B. RECOMMENDED DELETIONS

### Safe to Delete - Hardcoded Logic:
1. `litmus_test.py` - Contains hardcoded timestamps
2. `backup_before_cleaning/` directory - All files contain old hardcoded logic
3. Test files with hardcoded values for testing

### Safe to Delete - Dead Code:
1. Unused imports across all files
2. Unused variables in exception handlers
3. Syntax error files in backup directory

### Must Keep (Whitelisted):
- `phase0_purge_hardcoded.py` - Removes hardcoded logic
- `remove_hardcoded_logic.py` - Removes hardcoded logic
- All `phase1_*.py` files - Core AI functionality
- `ai/` directory (if exists) - Future AI modules
- `config/` directory - Configuration
- `tests/` directory - Test suite (except hardcoded test data)

## C. DISK USAGE
Current repository size: ~47MB (185 files)

## D. SAFETY NOTES
- All main pipeline files are clean of hardcoded logic
- The "hardcoded" references are mostly in:
  - Documentation files explaining the problem
  - Scripts that REMOVE hardcoded logic
  - Old backup files
  - Test data

## RECOMMENDATION
Proceed with cleanup focusing on:
1. Delete `backup_before_cleaning/` directory entirely
2. Remove unused imports from all Python files
3. Keep all phase*.py files as they implement the solution
