P1-04: ROVER O(n log n) Highlight Merge Algorithm

This module implements an efficient O(n log n) merge algorithm for combining and 
optimizing video highlight segments. ROVER (Rapid Overlap Verification and Efficient Ranking)
provides:

- Efficient segment overlap detection and merging
- Quality-based ranking with multiple scoring factors
- Timeline optimization and gap analysis
- Duplicate detection and consolidation
- Memory-efficient processing for large segment lists
