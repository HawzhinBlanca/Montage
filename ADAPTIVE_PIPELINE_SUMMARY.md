# Adaptive Quality Pipeline - Implementation Summary

## The Problem We Solved

The original tri-lane model (Fast/Smart/Premium) created **decision paralysis**:
- Users stared at 3 buttons, unsure which to choose
- Wrong choice = wasted time or money
- No middle ground between tracks
- Feature creep inevitable in "Smart" track

## The Solution: ONE Button

**Adaptive Quality Pipeline** - System decides optimal processing path automatically.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. VideoProbe (`video_probe.py`)
- Analyzes first 10 seconds of video
- Detects:
  - Speaker count (using audio energy patterns)
  - Music presence (frequency analysis)
  - Scene changes (histogram differences)
  - Motion intensity (optical flow)
  - Face count (OpenCV cascade)
  - Technical content density
- Returns complexity classification and cost/time estimates

### 2. AdaptiveQualityPipeline (`adaptive_quality_pipeline.py`)
- Main orchestrator with ONE `process()` method
- Automatically selects from 4 internal modes:
  - **FAST**: <5min, 1 speaker, simple → Free, instant
  - **SMART**: Medium complexity → Local ML only
  - **SMART_ENHANCED**: Smart + selective API usage for top moments
  - **SELECTIVE_PREMIUM**: Complex sections get expensive tools
- Respects user constraints (budget, privacy, time)

### 3. SmartTrack (`smart_track.py`)
- Local-only ML processing (no cloud APIs)
- Uses OpenCV for:
  - Motion detection (background subtraction)
  - Face detection and tracking
  - Scene change detection
  - Audio energy analysis
- Combines multiple signals to find best moments
- Adds smart crop parameters for faces

### 4. SelectiveEnhancer (`selective_enhancer.py`)
- Cost-aware API usage
- Only enhances top 20% of segments
- Features:
  - Transcription (Whisper) only when needed
  - GPT analysis for complex/technical content
  - Speaker diarization for multi-speaker sections
- Stays within budget constraints

### 5. ProgressiveRenderer (`progressive_renderer.py`)
- Shows results as they process:
  1. **Preview** (10s): First highlight in low quality
  2. **Basic** (60s): Full video, fast encoding
  3. **Enhanced** (90s): Better quality if user waiting
  4. **Final** (120s): Best quality in background
- Prevents user anxiety with immediate feedback

## How It Works

```python
# User perspective - ONE line of code
result = await pipeline.process(video_path)

# What happens internally:
1. Quick probe (10s) → Understand video
2. Auto-select mode → Based on complexity
3. Process intelligently → Right tools for content
4. Progressive output → See results immediately
```

## Example Routing Logic

```python
if video.duration < 5min and video.speakers == 1:
    → FAST mode (free, 30s)
    
elif video.speakers > 2 or video.technical_density > 0.7:
    if budget_allows and cloud_enabled:
        → SELECTIVE_PREMIUM (smart spending)
    else:
        → SMART_ENHANCED (best we can do locally)
        
else:
    → SMART or SMART_ENHANCED (based on constraints)
```

## Cost Control

- **Selective Enhancement**: Only top 20% of moments get API treatment
- **Surgical Premium**: Expensive tools only on complex sections
- **Budget Guard**: Hard stop when limit reached
- **Progressive Rendering**: User can stop when satisfied

## Key Innovation

**Remove the choice, not the options.** The system has multiple processing paths but the user sees only ONE button. This eliminates:

1. Decision paralysis
2. Wrong choices
3. Upgrade cliffs
4. Feature confusion

## Results

- **Before**: User picks wrong track → Bad experience → Never returns
- **After**: System picks optimal track → Good experience → Happy user

## Next Steps

1. Add user success metrics tracking
2. Implement selective diarization
3. Create simple ONE-button UI
4. A/B test against 3-button interface

## The Philosophy

> "The best interface is no interface. The best choice is no choice. Just make it work."

Users upload video, get magic. No cognitive load. No decision fatigue. Just results.
