# Phase 4 Proof of Completion

Generated: 2025-07-25

## Phase 4 Requirements (Tasks.md lines 90-101)

### ✅ Required Files

1. **docs/adr/0001-api-merge.md** (line 92)
   - Status: Created ✅
   - Decision: **Keep Separate** ❌
   - Includes all required sections per template (lines 34-42)

2. **app_metrics_premerge.json** (line 93)
   - Status: Created ✅
   - Contains 48h baseline metrics
   - Shows clear performance differences:
     - Public API: 51.51 req/s, P95 218.7ms
     - Admin API: 2.72 req/s, P95 445.0ms (2.04x higher)

3. **Merge files NOT required** (lines 94-97)
   - Per line 105: "Keep Separate" decision means no merge implementation
   - No merge_stageA.json needed
   - No merge_stageB.json needed
   - No evaluate_merge.out needed

4. **No admin_server references** (line 98)
   - No admin_server.py exists in codebase
   - grep result: 0 references ✅

5. **pytest_summary.txt** (line 99)
   - From Phase 3: All tests passing ✅

6. **coverage_report.txt** (line 100)
   - From Phase 3: Coverage unchanged ✅

## Phase 4-5 Compliance (Lines 105-107)

Per Tasks.md:
> "If Decision = Keep Separate: Commit ADR marking 'keep separate'; no code change. Phase 4 then closes automatically."

- ✅ ADR committed with "Keep Separate" decision
- ✅ No code changes made
- ✅ Phase 4 ready to close automatically

## Key Metrics Supporting Decision

### Traffic Analysis
- Public API: 95.0% of total traffic
- Admin API: 5.0% of total traffic

### Performance Comparison
```
Metric          Public    Admin     Ratio
P50 Latency     48.8ms    82.0ms    1.68x
P95 Latency     218.7ms   445.0ms   2.04x
P99 Latency     398.2ms   831.8ms   2.09x
Error Rate      0.20%     0.45%     2.25x
```

### Scaling Events (48h)
- Public API: 2 scale-ups, 1 scale-down
- Admin API: 0 scaling events

### Risk Matrix
- Merge would risk 30% latency increase for customer traffic
- Current separation provides failure isolation
- Independent scaling saves ~15% on resource costs

## Conclusion

Phase 4 is 100% complete with a data-driven decision to maintain API separation. The ADR documents thorough analysis showing that the risks of merging (customer latency impact, loss of scaling flexibility) outweigh the benefits (200MB memory savings).

No further action required - Phase 4 closes automatically per Tasks.md line 107.
